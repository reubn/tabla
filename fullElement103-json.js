Lawrencium is a synthetic rare-earth metal. There are eight known radioisotopes, the most stable being ²⁶²Lr with a half-life of 3.6 hours. Due to the short half-life of Lawrencium, and its radioactivity, there are no known uses for it. Identified by Albert Ghiorso in 1961 at Berkeley. It was produced by bombarding Californium with Boron ions. The name is temporary IUPAC nomenclature, the origin of the name comes from Ernest O. Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron. If sufficient amounts of Lawrencium were produced, it would pose a radiation hazard.","no":"Named in honor of Ernest O.
