Good resistance to corrosion by alkalis, sulphuric and hydrochloric acid. It oxidizes readily about 933K. There are two naturally occurring isotopes of Vanadium, and 5 radioisotopes, ⁴⁹V having the longest half-life at 337 days. Vanadium has nuclear applications, the foil is used in cladding Titanium to steel, and Vanadium-gallium tape is used to produce a superconductive magnet. Originally discovered by Andres Manuel del Rio of Mexico City in 1801. His discovery went unheeded, however, and in 1820, Nils Gabriel Sefstron of Sweden rediscovered it. Metallic Vanadium was isolated by Henry Enfield Roscoe in 1867. The name Vanadium comes from Vanadis, a goddess of Scandinavian mythology. Silvery-white metallic transition element. Vanadium is essential to Ascidians. Rats and chickens are also known to require it. Metal powder is a fire hazard, and Vanadium compounds should be considered highly toxic. May cause lung cancer if inhaled.","no":"From Scandinavian goddess, Vanadis.","disc":"Nils Sefström","discLoc":"Sweden","discYear":1830,"ann":""}')}}]);
