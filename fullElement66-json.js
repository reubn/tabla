Dysprosium belongs to the lanthanoids. It is relatively stable in air at room temperatures, it will however dissolve in mineral acids, evolving Hydrogen. It is found in from rare-earth minerals. There are seven natural isotopes of Dysprosium, and eight radioisotopes, ¹⁵⁴Dy being the most stable with a half-life of 3*10^6 years. Dysprosium is used as a neutron absorber in nuclear fission reactions, and in compact disks. It was discovered by Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1886 in France.
