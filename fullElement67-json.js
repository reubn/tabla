It oxidizes in moist air and at high temperatures. It belongs to the lanthanoids. A rare-earth metal, it is found in the minerals monazite and gadolinite. It possesses unusual magnetic properties. One natural isotope, ¹⁶⁵Ho exists, six radioisotopes exist, the most stable being ¹⁶³Ho with a half-life of 4570 years. Holmium is used in some metal alloys, it is also said to stimulate the metabolism. Discovered by Per Theodor Cleve and J.L. Soret in Switzerland in 1879. The name homium comes from the Greek word Holmia which means Sweden. While all Holmium compounds should be considered highly toxic, initial evidence seems to indicate that they do not pose much danger. The metal\'s dust however, is a fire hazard.","no":"From Holmia, the Latinized name for Stockholm, Sweden.","disc":"J.L. Soret","discLoc":"Switzerland","discYear":1878,"ann":""}')}}]);
