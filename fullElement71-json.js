It happens to be the most expensive rare-earth metal. Its found with almost all rare-earth metals, but is very difficult to separate from other elements. Least abundant of all natural elements. Used in metal alloys, and as a catalyst in various processes. There are two natural, stable isotopes, and seven radioisotopes, the most stable being ¹⁷⁴Lu with a half-life of 3.3 years. The separation of Lutetium from Ytterbium was described by Georges Urbain in 1907. It was discovered at approximately the same time by Carl Auer von Welsbach. The name comes from the Greek word lutetia which means Paris.","no":"Named for the ancient name of Paris, Lutecia.","disc":"Georges Urbain","discLoc":"France","discYear":1907,"ann":""}')}}]);
