Salts of Iridium are highly colored. It is the most corrosion resistant metal known, not attacked by any acid, but is attacked by molten salts. There are two natural isotopes of Iridium, and 4 radioisotopes, the most stable being ¹⁹²Ir with a half-life of 73.83 days. ¹⁹²Ir decays into Platinum, while the other radioisotopes decay into Osmium. Iridium is used in high temperature apparatus, electrical contacts, and as a hardening agent for platinumpy. Discovered in 1803 by Smithson Tennant in England. The name comes from the Greek word iris, which means rainbow. Iridium metal is generally non-toxic due to its relative unreactivity, but Iridium compounds should be considered highly toxic.","no":"Latin: iris (rainbow).","disc":"S.Tenant, A.F.Fourcory, L.N.Vauquelin, H.V.Collet-Descoltils","discLoc":"England/France","discYear":1804,"ann":""}')}}]);
