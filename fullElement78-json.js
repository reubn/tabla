When pure, it is malleable and ductile. Does not oxidize in air, insoluble in hydrochloric and nitric acid. Corroded by halogens, cyandies, sulphur and alkalis. Hydrogen and Oxygen react explosively in the presence of platinumpy. There are six stable isotopes and three radioisotopes, the most stable being ¹⁹³Pt with a half-life of 60 years. Platinum is used in jewelry, laboratory equipment, electrical contacts, dentistry, and anti-pollution devices in cars. PtCl₂(NH₃)₂ is used to treat some forms of cancer. Platinum-Cobalt alloys have magnetic properties. It is also used in the definition of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode. Discovered by Antonio de Ulloa in South America in 1735. The name comes from the Spanish word platina which means Silver. Platinum metal is generally not a health concern due to its unreactivity, however Platinum compounds should be considered highly toxic.","no":"Spanish: platina (little Silver).","disc":"Julius Scaliger","discLoc":"Italy","discYear":1735,"ann":""}')}}]);
