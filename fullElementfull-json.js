Gold is used as a monetary standard, in jewelry, dentistry, electronics. Au-198 is used in treating cancer and some other medical conditions. Gold has been known to exist as far back as 2600 BC. Gold comes from the Anglo-Saxon word gold. Its symbol, Au, comes from the Latin word aurum, which means gold. Gold is not particularly toxic, however it is known to cause damage to the liver and kidneys in some.","no":"Anglo-Saxon: geolo (yellow); symbol from Latin: aurum (shining dawn).","disc":"Known to the ancients.","discLoc":null,"discYear":null,"ann":""},{"an":80,"n":"Mercury","s":"Hg","am":200.592,"ec":[54,{"sh":4,"su":"f","e":14},{"sh":5,"su":"d","e":10},{"sh":6,"su":"s","e":2}],"gb":"transitionMetal","cas":"7439-97-6","i":[{"n":116,"a":0.0015},{"n":118,"a":0.1004},{"n":119,"a":0.1694},{"n":120,"a":0.2314},{"n":121,"a":0.1317},{"n":122,"a":0.2974},{"n":124,"a":0.0682}],"ies":[[1,10.437504],[2,18.75687],[3,34.46],[4,48.55],[5,61.2],[6,76.6],[7,93],[8,113.9],[9,134],[10,153],[11,173],[12,192.7],[13,276.9],[14,307],[15,332],[16,357],[17,402],[18,429],[19,477],[20,530],[21,560],[22,590],[23,650],[24,710],[25,760],[26,820],[27,880],[28,930],[29,990],[30,1050],[31,1110],[32,1160],[33,1220],[34,1280],[35,1549],[36,1603],[37,1661],[38,1723],[39,1780],[40,1839],[41,1928],[42,1989],[43,2052],[44,2113],[45,2354],[46,2412],[47,2478],[48,2539],[49,2745],[50,2815],[51,2981],[52,3049.9],[53,5055],[54,5191],[55,5335],[56,5490],[57,5636],[58,5780],[59,6041],[60,6192],[61,6356],[62,6508],[63,6933],[64,7066],[65,7211],[66,7350],[67,8000],[68,8160],[69,8470],[70,8620],[71,18550],[72,18910],[73,19310],[74,19680],[75,22120],[76,22580],[77,23170],[78,23544.1],[79,94124.7],[80,95897.7]],"os":[0,1,2],"g":12,"p":6,"b":"d","bp":629.73,"mp":234.28,"d":13.546,"eh":58.5,"fh":2.295,"sph":0.138,"hof":61.38,"tc":8.3,"ar":157,"av":14.8,"mr":139,"vdwr":223,"cr":133,"crd":142,"crt":null,"gbas":null,"dp":33.91,"ea":null,"pa":null,"en":1.9,"lc":2.99,"ls":"RHL","c6":null,"ca":0.085,"sa":0.000029999999999999997,"u":"Used in thermometers, barometers, and batteries.
